    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>Our team makes this whole thing go. From the very beginning, our culture has been defined by our people–we love
        what we do, and who we do it with. Whether it’s the products we build for students and tutors, or the training
        and development program we built for employees, everything we do here at Wyzant is a reflection of our
        collective drive to make education more accessible and better than ever before..</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>One-to-one learning works. We’ve believed that from day one. But we also knew it would work better if it were
        accessible, affordable, and more convenient for everyone. So that’s what we’ve built—an easier way to connect
        people who need to know with the experts that can teach them. And we’ve changed the way people think about
        education in the process</p>
    <h2>Our Guiding Values</h2>
    <p>We’re strong believers in the concept of team. Each employee has the opportunity to make his or her mark while we
        work together to upend an industry. We’re collaborative and inclusive; everyone’s accessible and open to ideas
        from any brain in the building. We’d even listen to the office dogs if we knew what they were thinking.</p>
